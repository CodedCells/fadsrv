THis code is a bit old, my current versions I use are incomplete and a bit messy.
This is stable but lacks some Quality of Life tweaks
Once I've got my version neat I'll upload it

This project is a bit more techie, you should have a good understanding of Python 3 ideally
just in general, but it helps if you run into any problems

updating to new fadsrv should be smooth, but depending on customisations or config you may run into problems

FADSRV allows the easy browsing of art from Fur Affinity, for filtering and sorting content.
My build has sets which work similar to e621 where posts can be added and browsed easily.
